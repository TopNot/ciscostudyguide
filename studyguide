VLANS

	Making VLANs

		conf t
		vlan (VLAN ID)
		name (VLAN name)
		end

	Assigning a Port to a VLAN

		conf t
		int (interface)
		switchport mode access
		switchport mode access vlan (vlan id)
		end

	Remove VLAN assignment

		conf t
		no switchport mode access vlan (vlan id)
		end

	Trunk Configuration

		conf t
		int (interface)
		switchport mode trunk
		switchport trunk native vlan (vlan id)
		switchport allowed vlan (vlan id)
		end

	Inter-VLAN Routing

		int g0/0.(SUBINTERFACE)
		encapsulation dot1q (SUBINTERFACE)
		ip address (ip address)


DHCP

	Excluded Addresses

		ip dhcp excluded-address (low ip) - (high ip)

	OR

		ip dhcp excluded-address (ip)

	Making a Pool

		ip dhcp pool (name)
		network (network address and subnet)
		default-router (ip address)
		dns-server (ip address, if applicable)
		domain-name (URL, if applicable)

	IP Helper Address

		int (interface)
		ip helper-address (ip address)
		end


ACL's

	About ACL's

		Extended ACLs should be placed as close as possible to the source of the traffic it will be filtering. This way, 
		
		undesirable traffic is denied early on and the traffic will not have to pass the network infrastructure.
		
		Standard ACLs should be placed as close to the destination as possible, placing a standard ACL at the source of the 
		
		traffice will effectivly block that traffic from reaching any other devices on network. This is because standard 
		
		ACLs do not specify a destination address.

	Configuring ACLs

		Standard ACLs

			access-list (interface) (permit or deny) (ip address) (subnet mask) 

		Extended ACLs

			access-list (port number) (deny/permit) (protocol) (source) (wildcard)


NAT

	STATIC

		ip nat (inside/outside) (source) (static ip) (local/global)

	INSIDE

		int (interface)
		ip nat inside

	OUTSIDE

		int (interface)
		ip nat outside

	DYNAMIC NAT

		ip nat pool (name) (start ip) (end ip) (netmask) (prefix)
		access-list (ACL number) (permit or deny) (source) (wildcard)
